Hi all!

On August 20, Estonia marks a unique holiday - the Day of Restoration of Independence. 08/20/1991 Estonia regained its independence.
Right now, outside the window, a many-thousands-strong choir sings patriotic songs and thunders salute.

And I am rolling out to the sounds of the salute ... Selenide 4.13.0

There were more changes than it seemed to me. :)

<br>

# Added method `$.lastChild()`

It finds the last child element of given element. Like `$("table").lastChild().shouldHave(cssClass("lastRow"));`

See [examples in Selenide tests](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/blob/master/src/test/java/integration/LastChildTest.java)

Thanks to [SymonK](https://github.com/symonk) for [PR 771](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/771)

# Added collection checks with custom timeout 

As you know, Selenide always had method `$.waitUntil(condition, timeout)` for waiting for some event with non-standard timeout. 
Now we added similar method for collections.
Though, we decided not to name it `waitUntil`, because this name doesn't match well with condition names: 
`$$.waitUntil(texts("a", "b", "c"))` doesn't sound well in English. Instead, we use the same name as before:

* `$$.shouldBe(empty, 9000)`
* `$$.shouldHave(size(4), 9000)`

See more examples [in Selenide tests](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/blob/master/statics/src/test/java/integration/CollectionWaitTest.java).

See [issue 601](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/601) and [PR 781](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/781)

# Added method `Selenide.download(url)`

It downloads a file by direct link. But downloads as it was downloaded by browser.
Technically speaking, Selenide performs Http GET request with your provided URL, but adds cookies and `User-Agent` header from currently opened webdriver.

See more examples [in Selenide tests](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/blob/master/statics/src/test/java/integration/DirectFileDownloadTest.java).

See [PR 782](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/782)

# Upgraded to Selenium 3.14.0

Just in case, I have to mention that `SelenideElement` doesn't implement the following deprecated interfaces anymore:
* `FindsByLinkText`
* `FindsById`
* `FindsByName`
* `FindsByTagName`
* `FindsByClassName`
* `FindsByCssSelector`
* `FindsByXPath`
* `HasIdentity`

I believe it will not affect you. Just in case.

See [PR 773](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/773)

# Fixed Selenide own tests Firefox

Probably you remember the historical moment when webdriver for Firefox already didn't work, but Geckodriver (aka Marionette) didn't work yet.
At that moment we had to "temporarily" disable Selenide own tests in Firefox. And recently we discovered that there have been disables for last N years :(

Now we finally enabled them back and fixed. We had to fix quite a lot of things... We probably even fixed some Firefox-specific bugs. :)  

See [PR 778](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/778)

## News

* A great fragment of a phrase in a chat:
  
  > I use Java not only for being Java, but also for existing sweeties: Selenide, RestAssured etc.

* We discovered two new frameworks, both powered by Selenide:
  * [Selenium Automation Bundle](https://github.com/sysgears/selenium-automation-bundle)
  * [Neodymium](https://github.com/Xceptance/neodymium-library)

* You can generate a new Selenide + Maven + JUnit5 sample project with just one line!

For example:

```
mvn archetype:generate -B
  -DarchetypeGroupId=org.selenide -DarchetypeArtifactId=selenide-junit5-archetype
  -DgroupId=com.example -DartifactId=ui-tests -Dpackage=com.example.project.ui
```

See [Maven Archetype Documentation](https://github.com/vinogradoff/selenide-junit5-archetype) for further instructions.

I'll be back!
