Good night!

I am passionate about Catholic Christmas.
Because it was on Christmas that the terrorists took over the Nakatomi plaza and Bruce killed Hans Gruber.
And then he blew up the plane with a lighter.

So catch the Christmas release [Selenide 5.17.0](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/milestone/108?closed=1).

# Added method $.as("name")

We added method `as`, so that you can give elements readable names.   

To feel the difference, let's compare the following two lines in test:

```java
  $(By.xpath("/long/ugly/xpath[1][2][3]")).shouldNot(exist);
  $(By.xpath("/long/ugly/xpath[1][2][3]")).as("Login button").shouldNot(exist);
```

The test result looks like this:

```
  +---------------------------------------+--------------------+----------+----------+
  |Element                                |Subject             |Status    |ms.       |
  +---------------------------------------+--------------------+----------+----------+
  |By.xpath: /long/ugly/xpath[1][2][3]    |should not(exist)   |PASS      |13        |
  |Login button                           |should not(exist)   |PASS      |38        |
  +---------------------------------------+--------------------+----------+----------+
```

In the last line, we see a readable name "Login button" instead of long unreadable xpath.  

NB! Don't rush with using this feature. I personally take it as a "last sort hack".  
It's always better to see the real locator instead of a name which always may happen to be:
* Deceiving
* Deprecated
* Misleading

It's always better to invest your time in readable locator, method names, well-organized tests etc.
This is where the real power lies. 

See [issue 1200](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/1200) and [PR 1353](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1353).

# Added bunch of default options to headless chrome

We added the same default options to headless chrome [as in Puppeteer](https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/blob/7a2a41f2087b07e8ef1feaf3881bdcc3fd4922ca/src/Launcher.js#L261).  
We assume that Puppeteer guys are smart, so we do like them. :)  

Thanks to [Aliaksandr Rasolka](https://github.com/rosolko) for [PR 1329](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1329).

# Fixed `ByShadowCss.findElements`

It returned only subset of elements in a particular case: when DOM contained multiple _inner shadow hosts_. 

Now it returns all the elements.  

See [issue 1346](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/1346). 
Thanks to [Daniel H. Peger](https://github.com/dpeger) for [PR 1347](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1347).

# Added $.should* methods with custom timeout

As you know, there are two major groups of methods in Selenide:
1. `$.shouldHave` / `$.shouldBe` / `$.should`  --  use default timeout
2. `$.waitUntil` / `$.waitWhile`  --  use given timeout

`$.wait*` are useful for "long" actions that last longer than the default timeout (which is 4 seconds by default).  

<br>

The problem with `$.wait*` methods is purely grammatical: Selenide built-in conditions don't sound correctly with verb "wait":
1. `element should have text` - sounds right
2. `element wait until text` - doesn't sound right

Now you can replace `$.waitUntil(hasText("bob"), 18_000)` by `$.shouldHave(text("bob"), Duration.ofSeconds(18))`. 

See [issue 1136](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/1136), 
[issue 1338](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/1338) and 
[PR 1340](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1340).

# Page objects
The next block of improvements concerns the Page Objects. 

As you know, in Selenide it's possible to create page objects 
* with fields annotated with `@FindBy`, 
* which can be standard selenium `WebElement`,
* or our `SelenideElement`,
* or even reusable components `ElementsContainer` which can be used to compose more complex page objects.  

And it all works in the best traditions of selenide: lazy loading and reloading of elements etc.

<br>

There were some issues with those `@FindBy` fields: 
1. lazy loading didn't work for PO fields of type `List<ElementsContainer>` (see issue [282](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/282) and [482](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/482))
2. PO fields of generic types were not supported (see [issue 694](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/694))

It was hard to fix. I had to dive into (quite old) code and refactor it.
I had to strain my brains and apply all my remnants of the former abstract thinking. :) 

That's why these two pull requests are my pride:
* [support page object fields of generic types](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1351)
* [enable lazy loading for Page Object fields of type `List<ElementsContainer>`](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1354)


<br>

# And finally, a couple of technical improvements:
* split Selenide project to subprojects - see [PR 1348](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1348)
* fixed Selenide tests that depended on OS - see [issue 1344](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/1344) and 
  [PR 1345](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1345), thanks to [Daniel H. Peger](https://github.com/dpeger) 
* cleaned up `Plugins` code  --  thanks to [Yuri Orlov](https://github.com/yorlov) for [PR 1343](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1343) 
* upgraded to browserup-proxy:2.1.2 and guava:30.1-jre
* added support for chrome 88, edge 89, opera 73

<br>

### Known issues:
* file [selenide-5.17.0-javadoc.jar](https://search.maven.org/remotecontent?filepath=com/codeborne/selenide/5.17.0/selenide-5.17.0-javadoc.jar) 
  happened to be incomplete: it doesn't contain javadoc for some of Selenide classes. Will be fixed in 5.17.1.

# Summarizing
In general, we end the year on a positive note:  
performed a non-trivial refactoring and fixed several old pains.   
We are entering the New Year with only one screen in [github issues](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues) instead of two.  


And the number of downloads of selenide has grown over the year from 102 to 167 thousand.
