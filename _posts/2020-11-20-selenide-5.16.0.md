Good night!

We released [Selenide 5.16.0](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/milestone/105?closed=1).


## Plugin system

One of the major plans for this year in [Selenide roadmap](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/wiki/Selenide-Roadmap) 
was to create a plugins system. It took time, but now  
 
**the day has come!** 

Currently there are two Selenide plugins available:
* [selenide-appium 1.5.0](https://github.com/selenide/selenide-appium)
* [selenide-selenoid 1.0.0](https://github.com/selenide/selenide-selenoid)

We will describe them in following posts.  

Apparently, we are going to create next plugins for Allure, JUnit, TestNG, AShot.  
_Please share your ideas too!_

See [issue #1051](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/1051) and 
[PR #1264](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1264),
[PR 1317](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1317) and
[PR 1321](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1321).


## Error messages

One of core Selenide functions is forming error messages in case of test failures.  
Sometimes these error messages can also be incomplete or unclear, especially in some corner cases.  
In this release, we did a whole bunch of fixes for error messages.   

### Improved error messages for AND and NOT checks

A canonical way to perform a negative check in Selenide is method `shouldNotHave`.  
And if you want to perform multiple checks - just write them in a line using commas: 
```java
  $("#username").shouldNotHave(text("admin"));
  $("#username").shouldHave(text("____"), attribute("data-masked"));
```

But there are alternative methods `Condition.not` and `Condition.and` for specific cases. For example, you can declare 
composite conditions, thus creating DSL for your tests.  

```java
  public class MyConditions {
    private static final Condition NONADMIN = not(text("admin"));
    private static final Condition MASKED = and("MASKED", text("___"), attribute("data-masked"));
  }

  public class MyTest {
    $("#username").shouldBe(MASKED);
    $("#username").shouldBe(NONADMIN);
  }
```

We found that these methods showed incomplete information in test reports:

```java
  | #username |should be(MASKED)                  |PASS |
  | #username |should have(not text)              |PASS |
```

The problem is that we don't see the expected text ("admin") and other conditions.  

Now we fixed this problem, and you will see the expected text:

```java
  | #username |should be(MASKED: text '___' and attribute data-masked)      |PASS |
  | #username |should have(not text 'admin')                                |PASS |
```

Thanks to [Pavel Fokin](https://github.com/fokinp) for [PR 1306](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1306) 
and [PR 1306](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1300).

### Added information about parents

In Selenide, you can find elements inside other elements. Like this:
```java
  $("#user-table").$("thead").$("trrrr-chah-chah").shouldHave(text("Age"));
```
But if such a check failed, you could see only the child element's locator in the error message:
```java
  Element not found {trrrr-chah-chah}
```

Now we added information about its parents too:
```java
  Element not found {#user-table/thead/trrrr-chah-chah}
```

Thanks to [Petro Ovcharenko](https://github.com/petroOv-PDFfiller) for [PR 1312](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1312).

### We added actual texts for `ownText` and `exactOwnText` checks
As you remember, in Selenide 5.15.0 we added checks `ownText` and `exactOwnText`:

```java
  $("#child_div1").shouldHave(ownText("Sonar"));
```
But if such check failed, you didn't see the actual "own text", but only the whole element's text with its children:

```java
  Element should have own text 'Sonar' {#child_div1}
  Element: '<div id="child_div1">Son</div>'
```

Now we added "Actual value" line with element's own text:
```java
  Element should have own text 'Sonar' {#child_div1}
  Element: '<div id="child_div1">Son</div>'
  Actual value: Son
```

See [issue 1261](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/1261) and [PR 1294](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1294).

### We throw the right exception if you try to upload a wrong file
If you tried to upload a missing file:
```java
  $("input[type='file']").uploadFile(new File("/foo/bar/xyz.pdf"));
```

you got an incorrect exception:
```java
  Element not found {input[type='file']}
  ...
  Caused by: InvalidArgumentException: invalid argument: File not found : /foo/bar/xyz.pdf
``` 

Not a big deal, but sometimes is might be misleading. 

Now we throw the right exception:

```java
  InvalidArgumentException: invalid argument: File not found : /foo/bar/xyz.pdf
``` 

See [issue 987](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/987) and [PR 1301](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1301).

> The root problem that Selenium doesn't have dedicated exception classes for all possible corner cases. 
> See [issues 1293](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/1293) for example. 
> Also some webdriver implementations can throw non-reasonable exceptions - for example, IEDriver threw 
> `Throwable` instead of `ElementNotFound` when I checked it last time.  
> 
> That's why we decided to use a conservative strategy in Selenide: if we couldn't detect the problem precisely, we
> assume that element not found, and you will see the real problem in the "caused by" block anyway.

### Show ClickOptions in the report
As you remember, in Selenide 5.15.0 we added generic methods for clicking with all kinds of options:
```java
  $("#page").click(usingJavaScript().offset(123, 222));
```

And again, we found that such a line was not readably in report:
```java
  | #page               |click(com.codeborne.selenide.ClickOptions@33617539)         |PASS |
```

Now we made it readable:
```java
  | #page               |click(method: JS, offsetX: 123, offsetY: 222)               |PASS |
```
See [issue 1302](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/1302) and [PR 1303](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1303).

## Other changes

### We added check `$$.shouldHave(exactTextsCaseSensitiveInAnyOrder(...))`

There are multiple collection checks in Selenide:
```java
  $$(".employee").shouldHave(texts("john", "bob", "katie"));            // case-insensitive, substring
  $$(".employee").shouldHave(textsInAnyOrder("john", "katie", "bob"));  // case-insensitive, substring, any order
  $$(".employee").shouldHave(exactTexts("john", "bob", "katie"));       // case-insensitive, full string match
```

Now we got one more:
```java
  // case-sensitive, full string match, any order
  $$(".employee").shouldHave(exactTextsCaseSensitiveInAnyOrder("John", "Bob", "Katie"));
```

Thanks to [Vitali Plagov](https://github.com/plagov) and [PR 1286](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1286).

<br/>

### We support `href`s with special symbols

As you remember, in Selenide 5.15.0 we added check `href`.  
But it didn't support `href` values with escaped characters, like in the second line:

```java
  $("a").shouldHave(href("/foo/bar/details.html"));    // works
  $("a").shouldHave(href("/files/some%20file.pdf"));   // fails
```

Now it's fixed.  

See [issue 1298](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/1298).  
Thanks to [rerednaw](https://github.com/rerednaw) and [PR 1299](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1299).

### Allow Chrome to download multiple files

There are such tricky links that cause downloading of two or more files.  
We found that Chrome shows a dialog "Are you sure you want all these files?" in this case. And this dialog blocks your 
test until user clicks "ok".  

> The worst thing about this problem is that it is very difficult to repeat it by hand: 
> the browser shows the dialog only the first time, so when running locally, most likely 
> you will not see it, and the test will be green. 

To fix this problem, we added an option `profile.default_content_setting_values.automatic_downloads=1` when running 
Chrome browser. This option allows Chrome to download multiple files without any dialogs.

See [issue 1307](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/1307).  
Thanks to [Alexei Vinogradov](https://github.com/vinogradoff) and [PR 1308](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1308).

### We allow downloading files with slashes in name

Until now, method `download` didn't allow a file which has slash in name:
 
```java
  File report = $("#report").download();
  
  --> IllegalArgumentException("File name cannot contain slash: 11/08/2020_-_day_transactions.pdf")
```


It seemed logical to us, because no file system allows creating of such files.    
But it turned out that sometimes the slash is quite logical - for example, as a separator in dates. 
And browsers can download such files. For example, Chrome simply replaces the slashes with underscores. 

Now Selenide also does it.  

See [issue 1322](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/1322) and [PR 1323](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1323).

### Fixed Guava version 30.0-jre

Oh, Guava!  

In Selenide own code, Guava is not used. We don't directly need it.   
But many other libraries still use _different versions of Guava_: Selenium, LittleProxy, BrowserUpProxy, Checkstyle... 

Selenide users periodically experienced problems when Maven or Gradle fetched transitively a wrong Guava version, 
 and Selenide didn't properly work.      
We are tired of it. Now Selenide explicitly declares a dependency on latest Guava version `30.0-jre`. We hope it will 
fix all those endless dependency issues. 

<br/>


### We migrated to Github Actions

As in any decent project, Selenide has its own set of automated tests (unit and integration), and they run
automatically for all branches on a CI server. We used to use Travis CI which provides a free service
for open-source projects. Thank them very much for the years of joint work. :)

But this year, Github started their own CI service "Github actions". It seemed reasonable to migrate to it.  

Now all Selenide builds can be found [right on github](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/actions).
