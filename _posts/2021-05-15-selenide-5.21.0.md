Good evening!  

We have released [Selenide 5.21.0](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/milestone/123?closed=1).

What's new there?

# We removed duplicate screenshots for chained locators

Most of Selenide methods are _chainable_ (aka _fluent_), so that you can call multiple methods in a line. 
Thus way you can write concise tests. 

Something like

```java
  $("table#id").$("tbody", 2).$("tr.active").$("td", 5)
    .shouldHave(text("Ну вот"))
    .click();
```

But there has been a problem with chained calls. If such a check failed, Selenide took multiple screenshots and 
added multiple steps to the report (incl. Allure report). One screenshot for `"table#id"`, another for `"tbody"` etc.  
Though it's essentially a single step. 

Though it was not critical, we have fixed this unpleasantness. Now Selenide will take one screenshot, and Allure report
 will contain one line. 

See [issue 1055](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/1055) and [PR 1465](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1465).

NB! We had to do quite a major refactoring, so something might go wrong. Feel free to share your feedback, let's fix it quickly!

<br>
# We added BrowserPerTestStrategyExtension 
... for reopening a browser on every test. 

By default Selenide reuses browser between tests (in a single thread). It's a good idea for performance: opening a new browser takes time.  
We assume you take care of the AUT state: clear cache, reset data, reload a page etc. in the beginning of every test. The exact clearing logic depends on your application anyway.  

But if you really want to open a new browser in every test, Selenide provides built-in mechanism for JUnit 4, JUnit 5 and TestNG. 

But we recently realized one missing feature for JUnit5. Selenide had only an extension for re-opening a browser before every _test class_ (`@ExtendWith({BrowserStrategyExtension.class}`), but not _test method_. 

Now we added such an extension. If you add `@ExtendWith({BrowserPerTestStrategyExtension.class}`, Selenide will open a new browser before every _test method_. 

_Don't forget it makes your tests slower!_ 

See [issue 1448](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/1448)
Thanks to [Anton Aftakhov](https://github.com/simple-elf) for [PR 1450](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1450).

# We added method `$.hover()` with offset

Selenide has method `$("div#123").hover()` for emulating moving cursor onto given element. 
But this method puts cursor in the center point of the element, and you could not influence that.  

Now we have overloaded method `$.hover()` with offset parameter. It allows you to specify how many pixels for the center point 
should be the cursor located:

```java
  $("div#123").hover(withOffset(123, 122));
```

P.S. It seems the offset does not always work precisely. In my tests, it was located _near_ this position plus-minus 30 pixels. 
Feel free to share your experience with hover!

See [issue 1447](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/1447) and [PR 1461](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1461).

# Upgraded to WebDriverManager 4.4.3

Thanks to [Anil Kumar Reddy Gaddam](https://github.com/anilreddy)
for [PR 1464](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1464) 
and [PR 1469](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1469).

# Updated javadoc of many Selenide methods
... regarding lazy loading and "not recommended" phrase.

Now javadoc has links to these wiki articles:
* [Lazy loading](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/wiki/Lazy-loading)
* [Not recommended](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/wiki/Do-not-use-getters-in-tests)

You will probably want to discuss these topics. Great, let's discuss them!

See [PR 1430](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1430)
