Good summer day!  

We released [Selenide 5.23.0](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/milestone/125?closed=1) on July, 16.  


It  introduces a fundamentally new feature in Selenide:

# The new generation checks

Now Selenide has checks not only for _web_ elements, but for some other elements too. 
You can apply those checks with built-in waitings, readable error messages, reports etc. Everything you like.  

See [issue 1442](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/1442).
Thanks to [Dmitriy Budim](https://github.com/dbudim) for launching this whole epic in [PR 1478](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1478).

<br/>
Let's look at these checks.

## Checks for URL
Until now, there were 2 methods in Selenide to get an URL of a current page or frame (in most cases it's the same value). 
```java
  String url1 = WebDriverRunner.url();
  String url2 = WebDriverRunner.currentFrameUrl();
```

Though, it was not clear how to check them or wait for a right url. 

Now we have such checks:

```java
import static com.codeborne.selenide.Selenide.webdriver;
import static com.codeborne.selenide.WebDriverConditions.*;

webdriver().shouldHave(url("https://auth.google.com"));
webdriver().shouldHave(url("https://mastercard.ee"), Duration.ofSeconds(42));
webdriver().shouldNotHave(url("http://yandex.ru");
webdriver().shouldNotHave(urlStartingWith("ftp://"));
webdriver().shouldHave(currentFrameUrl(baseUrl + "/login.html"));
webdriver().shouldHave(currentFrameUrlStartingWith(baseUrl + "/logout.html"));
```

Every of these checks:
1. waits up to 4 seconds (by default) if needed
2. appears in a report (text report or Allure)
3. takes a screenshot and throws a readable `ConditionNotMetException` if the url is not as expected after 4 seconds.

In the best traditions of selenide, you can
* override the default timeout (4 seconds) to any other number, e.g. `Configuration.timeout = 8000;`
* set a custom timeout for every check (as a second parameter like `Duration.ofSeconds(42)`)
* create custom checks (see [example](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/blob/c045579f243fb3a5abb99033e440cf8f12caa99c/statics/src/test/java/integration/WebDriverConditionsTest.java#L127))

## Checks for clipboard
Starting from version 5.20.0, Selenide has a method for accessing the clipboard:
```java
Clipboard clipboard = Selenide.clipboard();
```

But you could only get or set text to the clipboard:
```java
String foo = clipboard().getText();
clipboard().setText("bar");
```

Now you can also check the clipboard content. Again, with automated screenshots, reports, etc.  
```java
clipboard().shouldHave(content("Hello fast World"));
clipboard().shouldHave(content("Hello slow World"), Duration.ofMillis(1500));
```

See [PR 1507](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1507)

## Checks for `localStorage`
Starting from version 5.15.0, Selenide has method `localStorage()` which return JavaScript object `LocalStorage`.  
But it had only methods `getItem` and `setItem`. Again, it was not clear how to check them or wait for an item in the local storage.

Now it's clear:
* `localStorage().shouldHave(item("cat”));`
* `localStorage().shouldHave(itemWithValue("mouse", "Jerry”));`

By the way, we also added method `localStorage.getItems()` returning all the content of `localStorage` as a map. 

See [example of custom condition](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/blob/c045579f243fb3a5abb99033e440cf8f12caa99c/statics/src/test/java/integration/LocalStorageTest.java#L157) in Selenide tests.  

See [PR 1502](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1502)

## Checks for `sessionStorage`
The same as for `localStorage` - we added methods 
* `sessionStorage().shouldHave(item("cat”));`
* `sessionStorage().shouldHave(itemWithValue("mouse", "Jerry”));`
* `Map<String, String> items = sessionStorage.getItems();`

See [PR 1502](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1502)

# A small refactoring
We made classes `StaticConfig` and `StaticDriver` non-public.  
It seems they shouldn't be needed outside of Selenide. 
Do you occasionally use them in your project? Contact us if you are sure you need them.

# And a small bugfix:
Now method `Selenide.screenshot("filename")` (again) takes a screenshot even if setting `Configuration.screenshots` is `false`.

Let me clarify. 
1. You can set `Configuration.screenshots` to `false` if you need to disable _automated_ screenshots in case of test failures (actually, I don't really see any reasons to do that).  
2. You can use method `Selenide.screenshot("filename")` to take a screenshot at any moment you wish. Independently if the test status (I also don't really see any reasons to do that:))

The point is that method #2 works independently of setting #1. Now you can disable the automated screenshots and only take screenshots explicitly where needed (though, I still don't see any reasons why it should be a good idea).
