Good morning!  

For my birthday, we made an anniversary release [Selenide 5.22.0](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/milestone/124?closed=1).  

Let's unbox the gift!

# Now you can close an alert to download a file

Selenide has method `$.download()` which works by a very simple principle:
1. Click
2. Wait for a new file in a downloads folder

The problem is that some websites show an alert or some other dialog, and you need to close it to start downloading the file. Generally, you might need to perform some action to start the download process. 

Now you can [close the alert](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/blob/master/statics/src/test/java/integration/FileDownloadToFolderTest.java):
```java
File downloadedFile = $(byText("Download me with alert")).download(
      using(FOLDER).withAction(
        clickAndConfirm("Are you sure to download it?")
      )
    );
```

or perform [any other action](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/blob/master/statics/src/test/java/integration/FileDownloadViaProxyTest.java):
```java
File downloadedFile = $(byText("Download me with alert")).download(
    using(PROXY).withAction((driver, link) -> {
      // add cookies
      link.click();
      // driver.switchTo().window();
      // alert.dismiss();
      // send http request
      // call api
    }));
```

# We improved condition `textCaseSensitive`

... to support selected options in a `<select>` element - similar to `Condition.text`. 

Thanks to [Oleg Berezhnoy](https://github.com/bereg2k) for [PR 1482](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1482).

# We added selectors `byTextCaseInsensitive` and `withTextCaseInsensitive`

... for finding elements by text ignoring case. 

### Before
Selenide has methods for finding elements by text (case sensitive) for a long time:

* by the whole text: `$(byText("Wake up we have a tsar again")`
* by substring: `$(withText("we have a tsar")`

These selectors are case sensitive (and use XPath 1.0 inside). 

### After
Now we have added similar methods, but case insensitive:
* `$(byTextCaseInsensitive("wake UP we have a TSAR again")`
* `$(withTextCaseInsensitive("TSAR agAiN")`

These selectors can find element by text ignoring the case.  

### Technical nuance
we could not implement this feature by XPath because string functions like
`lower-case` and `match` were added in XPath 2.0, but all popular browsers support only XPath 1.0. 
That's why we had to write [a tricky JS code](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/blob/master/src/main/resources/find-elements-by-text-case-insensitive.js) to walk through the DOM tree.

See [issue 1380](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/1380) and [PR 1381](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1381).

# We added method `Driver.getSessionId()`

Basically it's needed in Selenide-Selenoid integration.

# We shortened default webdriver timeouts

There are two very strange timeouts inside of Selenium webdriver. I think it's a problem that they are abnormally large. And you cannot change them.

Here are these default timeouts:

* connect to a webdriver: `connectTimeout` = 120000 ms = 2 minutes
* any webdriver request: `readTimeout` = 10800000 ms = 3 hours (!)

If some webdriver command hangs for whatever reason, your test will wait for 3 hours.
For example, it happens when we test an Electron application and it goes to the system tray. The test tries to take a screenshot and hangs for a long time.
I really don't understand, is there anybody who thinks it's reasonable?

In Selenide 5.22.0 we added possibility to _change these default timeouts_ (it uses complex reflection under the hood).  
And we made these timeouts fewer (though they are still too conservative in my mind):
* `connectTimeout` = 1 minute
* `readTimeout` = 2 minutes

Let's consider it as a workaround and hope Selenium 4 brings a proper solution.  

See [PR 1433](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1433).
