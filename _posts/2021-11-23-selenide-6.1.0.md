# TERE!

<br>
We released [Selenide 6.1.0](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/milestone/137?closed=1).


<br>
# Added support for `selenide.properties`

Now Selenide can read its settings from file `selenide.properties` if it's found in classpath. 

NB! I personally still don't find it really useful. It's easier to just set settings
1. right in code: `Configuration.timeout = 8000;`
2. or via system properties: `-Dselenide.timeout=8000`. 

Please, don't rush generating these files. Use `selenide.properties` only if you have a good reason, 
and not simply because it is now fashionable or "beautiful".  

Thanks to [Petro Ovcharenko](https://github.com/petroOv-PDFfiller) for
[PR 1601](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1601).

# Added possibility for fine tuning the proxy

As you know, Selenide can run its embedded proxy server. It makes possible downloading of files, listening/intercepting requests etc. 
But capabilities of configuring the proxy were quite limited by now: only `Configuration.proxyHost` and `Configuration.proxyPort`. 

Now you can get the instance of BrowserModProxy and set it up as you wish before opening a browser.  

NB! Please don't overuse it. It's very easy to shoot yourself in the foot via re-configuring the proxy.  

And don't forget: if your settings really helped you, then maybe they will help others as well. 
Tell us what you set up there - maybe we should make these proxy settings default in Selenide? 

See [issue 1561](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/1561).
Thanks to [Boris Osipov](https://github.com/BorisOsipov) for
[PR 1620](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1620).


<br>
# Added a workaround against random `NoClassDefFoundError` in `WebDriverException`.

There is [a bug in Selenium](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/issues/9784) which is not entirely fixed yet. 
But you will not see it anymore because we added a workaround in Selenide code. :)

See [the workaround](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/commit/2eff0307e3a).


<br>
# Changed parameter type for method `SelenideConfig.browserCapabilities()`

... from `DesiredCapabilities` to `MutableCapabilities`. 

It allows to simplify your code. You don't need to wrap `ChromeOptions` into `DesiredCapabilities` anymore.
More about simplification of capabilities will be in the next release `Selenide 6.1.1`.  

See [PR 1637](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1637).


<br>
# Upgraded to Selenium Webdriver 4.1.0

Thanks to [Boris Osipov](https://github.com/BorisOsipov) for [PR 1638](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1638).

<br>
# Removed method `$.shadowRoot()`

This method got broken after upgrading to Chrome 96, and probably will be broken in other browsers soon.  
Taking into account that
1. It's hard to fix this method, and
2. This method [is not really useful](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/1515#issuecomment-894476289) since there are [better ways](/2020/03/18/selenide-5.10.0/) to find elements in Shadow DOM. 
we decided to just delete this method. Easy! :)

See [issue 1640](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/1640) and
[PR 1641](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1641).
