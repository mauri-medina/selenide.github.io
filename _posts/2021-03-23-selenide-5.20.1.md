Good night!  

Joe Biden was asked if he thinks `$$.as` is a killer feature. «Mmm hmm, I do», — Biden answered.

This is a double release notes for [Selenide 5.20.0](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/milestone/118?closed=1) and 
[Selenide 5.20.1](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/milestone/119?closed=1).

# We added operations with clipboard

* `Selenide.clipboard().setText("111");`
* `assertEquals("Hello World", Selenide.clipboard().getText());`

Note that clipboard doesn't work on Linux without graphical environment. 

Thanks to [Dmitriy Budim](https://github.com/dbudim) for [PR 1409](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1409). 

NB!These methods are overridden in [selenide-selenoid](https://github.com/selenide/selenide-selenoid) plugin to work correctly in Selenoid. 
We also released version [1.1.0](https://github.com/selenide/selenide-selenoid/releases/tag/v1.1.0) of the plugin.

# We added `headless` mode for Microsoft Edge

The setting `Configuration.headless` worked only for Chrome and Firefox, now it also works for Edge.  

(Browsers IE, Opera and Safari afaik still don't support headless mode) 

See [issue 1422](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/1422) 
and [PR 1424](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1424).

# We added method $$.as() for giving collection an alias

As you probably remember, we added method `$.as()` in Selenide 5.17.0. It allows to give an alias (human-readable name) to any `SelenideElement`. 

Now you can also given readable names to collections:

```java
$(By.xpath("/long/ugly/xpath[1][2][3]")).as("Login button").shouldBe(visible);
$$(By.xpath("/long/ugly/xpath[1][2][3]")).as("Login buttons").shouldHave(size(2));
```

See [issue 1389](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/1389)
and [PR 1431](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1431). 

NB! Don't rush with using this feature. I personally take it as a "last sort hack".  
It's always better to see the real locator instead of a name which always may happen to be:
* Deceiving
* Deprecated
* Misleading

It's always better to invest your time in readable locator, method names, well-organized tests etc.
This is where the real power lies.

# We added collection condition `containExactTextsCaseSensitive`

Existing method `$$.shouldHave(texts("a", "b", "c"))` checks that the collection contains exactly these elements, and not any others. 
But sometimes we want a less strict check. For example, you need to check that the traded currencies list contains EUR and USD - and any others. 

Now we have a method for such check:

```java
  $$.should(containTexts("EUR", "USD"));
```

Thanks to [Oleg Berezhnoy](https://github.com/bereg2k) for [PR 1426](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1426). 

**UPD** In release Selenide 5.20.1 it was renamed to 

```java
  $$.should(containExactTextsCaseSensitive("RUB", "EUR", "USD"));
```

Thanks to [Oleg Berezhnoy](https://github.com/bereg2k) for [PR 1438](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1438) and [PR 1439](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1439).

# Fixed the lost FirefoxOptions

In some situations some of Firefox options could be lost. Now they are not lost anymore.  

See [issue 1436](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/1436).
Thanks to [Dmitriy Budim](https://github.com/dbudim) for [PR 1437](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1437).

# Removed duplicate logging of "navigation" methods

`SelenideElement` has several methods to find other elements: 
* `$.findAll()`
* `$.parent()`
* `$.sibling()`
* `$.preceding()`
* `$.lastChild()`
* `$.closest()`

Such methods were logged twice: first when you call them, and second when you call another method of the the found element. 
Now we removed this duplication.

Thanks to [Pavel Fokin](https://github.com/fokinp) for [PR 1428](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1428).
