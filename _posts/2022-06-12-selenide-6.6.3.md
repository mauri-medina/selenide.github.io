# Good evening fellows!

<br>
We made a mini-release [Selenide 6.6.3](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/milestone/157?closed=1).


### Improved timeout for `$.click()` {#improve-click-timeout}

In version 6.6.0, we added an optional parameter `timeout` for method `$.click()`.  
But it appeared that it [only partially](/2022/06/08/selenide-6.6.0/#click-timeout) solved the problem.

Now we improved it: method 
```java
$("#slow-link").click(usingDefaultMethod().timeout(ofSeconds(8)));
```

waits 8 seconds for both the element itself and the following page loading. 

See [issue 1572](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/1572) and [PR 1853](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1853).

### Selenide 6.6.2 {#selenide-6.6.2}

A day before, we released [Selenide 6.6.2](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/milestone/156?closed=1) with upgrade to Selenium 4.2.2

See [PR 1851](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1851).

### Selenide 6.6.1 {#selenide-6.6.1}

Before this, we released [Selenide 6.6.1](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/milestone/155?closed=1)
with a tiny fix for an old [issue 1850](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/1850).
We restore `byte-buddy` dependency which was needed for adding listeners to webdriver.
