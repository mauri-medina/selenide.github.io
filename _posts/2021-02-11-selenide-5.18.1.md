Hi all!

We have release a small update [Selenide 5.18.1](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/milestone/115?closed=1).  

Let's look at the changes:  

<br>

# Added method `Selenide.getSessionStorage()`

... similar to `Selenide.getLocalStorage()` added in 5.15.0.

They both have the same set of methods: `getItem`, `setItem`, `removeItem`, `clear` etc.  

> Sometimes it's useful to set some flag to `sessionStorage` to `localStorage` to emulate some user action or
toggle some features or settings.

Thanks to [Dmitriy Budim](https://github.com/dbudim) for [PR 1400](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1400). 

P.S. FYI [difference between localStorage and sessionStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/sessionStorage).

# Fixed error message for `$$.filterBy(and(..))`

As you know, Selenide provides powerful API for filtering and validating collections.  

User [Pavel Fokin](https://github.com/fokinp) found that the error message can look misleading when 
the collection is filtered with `and` condition (a combination of other conditions):

```java
$$(".sofa").filterBy(and("shining", text("Jorshik"), text("Zoloto"))).shouldHave(size(2));
```
<br/>

The output was a bit misleading (because it showed only the last checked condition):
```java
... collection: .sofa.filter(text Jorshik)
```

Now the output contains all conditions:
```java
... collection: .sofa.filter(shining: text 'Jorshik' and text 'Zoloto')
```

See [issue 1392](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/1392).  
Thanks to [Pavel Fokin](https://github.com/fokinp) for [PR 1393](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1393).

# Pass "noproxy" option from user-provided proxy to Selenide proxy

As you know, Selenide can run its own embedded proxy server (used to download files, intercept requests etc.)
It's also possible to provide Selenide your own proxy. Then Selenide uses both proxies, one through the other.

Every proxy can have a setting "noproxy" which often has value "localhost". It mean that all requests 
_except "http://localhost:*"_ should be proxied. And this setting was lost when running Selenide 
with two proxies, Thus Selenide could not run requests to localhost. 

Now Selenide passes "noproxy" setting from your proxy to its own proxy. 

_Localhost is a delicate thing!_ 

Thanks to [Boris Osipov](https://github.com/BorisOsipov) for [PR 1390](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1390).

# Upgraded to Netty 4.1.59.Final and LittleProxy 2.0.2

It is unlikely that you will read them, but here are the release notes for 
[Netty 4.1.59.Final](https://netty.io/news/2021/02/08/4-1-59-Final.html) and 
[LittleProxy 2.0.2](https://github.com/mrog/LittleProxy/blob/master/RELEASE_NOTES.md). 
At lease they fixed some security issue and a memory leak.
