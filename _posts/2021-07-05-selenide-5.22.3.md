Good evening!  

There was a press release here that might hurt the feelings of many of our users and committers. We regret that this has happened, and we consider this publication to be our mistake, a manifestation of the unprofessionalism of certain maintainers.

So just upgrade to [Selenide 5.22.3](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/milestone/126?closed=1) with the most fresh and delicious bugfixes.
