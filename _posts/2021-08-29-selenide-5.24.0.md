On August 29, 1997 a computer system Skynet became self-aware and launched nuclear missiles at Russia.
So the war between humans and terminators began.

It happened .. oh, my god! - 24 years ago. We live in the Future, and we are still alive. And we still rule the machines.

I
I celebrate this day every year, and today, in honor of the holiday, we released [Selenide 5.24.0](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/milestone/130?closed=1).


<br>
# We added method `$.execute(Command, Duration)`

to run custom commands with a custom timeout. 

In [Selenide 5.3.0](https://ru.selenide.org/2019/09/02/selenide-5.3.0/) we added method `$.execute()` for running custom commands. 
But it could only use a default timeout. Now you can use custom timeout for any custom command.  

See [issue 1525](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/1525).  
Thanks to [Evgenii Plugatar](https://github.com/evpl) for [PR 1531](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1531).


<br>
# Methods `$.execute(Command)` and `$.execute(Command, Duration)` don't pass arguments to the command

It's a small change, but it might break your custom commands if you have some. Be prepared.  

See [issue 1527](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/1527).  
Thanks to [Evgenii Plugatar](https://github.com/evpl) for [PR 1535](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1535).


<br>
# We fixed `Or` and `And` conditions in case if element is not found

See [issue 1534](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/1534).  
Thanks to [Evgenii Plugatar](https://github.com/evpl) for [PR 1539](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1539).


<br>
# Now `Or` and `And` don't accept empty conditions list

I hope you never tried to use `Or` and `And` with an empty conditions list because it makes no sense. Anyway, now you will get a runtime exception if you try to.   
Thanks to [Evgenii Plugatar](https://github.com/evpl) for [PR 1542](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1542).


<br>
# We renamed methods `Condition.applyNull()` and `CollectionCondition.applyNull()`

Many years ago I named it `applyNull`, but this name is very misleading.  
This method checks if the condition is met if the element is not found at all. Now it's named `missingElementSatisfiesCondition()` - a rather long, but accurate.  

See [issue 1541](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/1541).  
Thanks to [Evgenii Plugatar](https://github.com/evpl) for [PR 1544](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1544).

# We removed useless stacktraces when closing the webdriver

As you know, Selenide automatically closes the webdriver when it's not needed anymore.
To make it possible, Selenide runs a few background threads which monitor the webdriver status. And sometimes these 
threads compete with each other and try to close the webdriver which has been already closed by another thread. 
You might see such stacktraces in your logs.

Now Selenide detects such situation better and doesn't print long useless stacktraces.

See [issue 1467](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/1467) and
[PR 1540](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1540)

# We fixed searching shadow roots inside of web elements

See [issue 1532](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/1532) and
[PR 1536](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1536)

The World doesn't consist of only Web and Mobile!  
You can also use Selenide for testing Swing applications! Here is [an example](https://github.com/framebassman/fest-selenide).
