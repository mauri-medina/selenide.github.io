# Good evening, friends!

<br>
We released [Selenide 6.4.0](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/milestone/145?closed=1).

<br>

## Now we show both alias and locator on test failure

In Selenide, you can use method `as` to give web elements readable names.  
It may be useful when the element has no good ID/class, and you have no choice but write long ugly unreadable xpath. 
It's hard to read such selectors in reports. 

Sample usage of `as`: 
```java
$x("/long/ugly/xpath/div[2]/span[3]/li[4]").as("Login button").click();
```

We always had a dilemma: should Selenide
1. show only alias (pros: easily readable, cons: locator is not visible - but it might be helpful)
2. show both alias and locator (pros: locator is visible, cons: hard to read).

<br/>

Finally, we realized what is the right way.  

Starting from version 6.4.0, Selenide will:
1. Show only alias in reports (@TextReport, Allure report etc.)
2. Show both alias and locator in error message in case of test failure

For example, the code mentioned above will look like this in report:
```
+----------------------+--------------------+------------+------------+
| Element              | Subject            | Status     | ms.        |
+----------------------+--------------------+------------+------------+
| Login button         | click()            | FAIL       | 206        |
+----------------------+--------------------+------------+------------+
```

And in error message:
```java
Element "Login button" not found {By.xpath: /long/ugly/xpath[1][2][3]}
Expected: exist
Screenshot: ...
```
See [issue 1765](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/1765) and [PR 1766](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1766).

<br>

## Added spaces in Selenide report

The report mentioned above looked like this until now:

```
+---------------------+-------------------+------------+------------+
|Element              |Subject            | Status     | ms.        |
+---------------------+-------------------+------------+------------+
|open                 |https://google.com/some-long-url.html?q=selenide|PASS       |1285       |
|Login button         |click()            | FAIL       | 206        |
+---------------------+-------------------+------------+------------+
```

The problem is that the long URL is wrapped with `|` characters on the left and right. It makes it impossible to 
easily select it with double click. Now a space will be added to the left and right of the URL and other values in the report.

And the report looks now nicer, right?
