# Happy Birthday, Selenide!

Wow! It's hard to believe, but today Selenide got ... 10 years old!

This day 10 years ago was created [the first commit](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/commit/3716078fc7fda8c5da01d871882d513cbd97cd0e) to Selenide github repository. 

Many thanks to everyone who participated in the project, committed, reported bugs, suggested ideas, answered questions in the forums,
criticized and talked about selenide at conferences and meetups. And who just decided to use Selenide in their projects.
You are all part of this movement. 

<br>
In honor of the anniversary, we released major version [Selenide 6.0.1](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/milestone/136?closed=1).


<br>
# Upgraded to Selenium Webdriver 4.0.0
Nothing really should change for you until you are using Selenium Grid. Everything more or less works as before.
Well, some classes were renamed or deprecated - it seems not scary. 

Selenium 4 also brings [new features](https://www.browserstack.com/guide/selenium-4-features) (like CDP and Relative locators), but haven't introduced any special support for them yet. Can work on it in next versions if needed.

See [issue 1162](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/1162),
[PR 1605](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1605), 
[PR 1614](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1614) and
[PR 1617](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1617).

# Splitted Selenide to several artifacts

Before now, the whole Selenide code was published as a single artifact: `selenide-5.25.0.jar`.  
And you had to add other dependencies like JUnit or TestNG, and probably BrowserMobProxy. 

Now we made it easier for you (especially with proxy). 

1. For JUnit5 users the dependency will not change: <br>`testImplementation("com.codeborne:selenide:6.0.1)`
2. JUnit4 users should use <br> `testImplementation("com.codeborne:selenide-junit4:6.0.1)`
3. TestNG users should use <br> `testImplementation("com.codeborne:selenide-testng:6.0.1)`
4. If you want to use proxy, it's enough to add dependency <br> `testImplementation("com.codeborne:selenide-proxy:6.0.1)` - and forget about all these BrowserUpProxy, Netty etc. 
5. And if you happen to be a radical hater of static methods, now you can also be happy by declaring <br> `testImplementation("com.codeborne:selenide-core:6.0.1)` - and then you will only have `SelenideDriver` without `Selenide.*` static methods. 

See [PR 1612](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1612).

# Removed lots of deprecated code

[Here](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1607/files) you can find what exactly was removed and how can you replaced it.   
In particular,
* `ElementsCollection.shouldHaveSize()` -> `ElementsCollection.shouldHave(size())`
* `$.waitUntil(_, timeout)` -> `$.should(_, Duration.ofMillis(timeout))`
* `$.waitWhile(_, timeout)` -> `$.shouldNot(_, Duration.ofMillis(timeout))`
* `Condition.disappears` -> `Condition.hidden`
* `Condition.matchesText` -> `Condition.matchText`
* `Selenide.close` -> `Selenide.closeWebDriver()` or `Selenide.closeWindow()`

Thanks to [Boris Osipov](https://github.com/BorisOsipov) for 
[PR 1607](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1607/files) and
[PR 1609](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1609).

# Remove support for browser "legacy_firefox"

It was an old webdriver that worked with Firefox 52 and earlier. I guess it's not used anymore. 

See [PR 1610](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1610).


<br>
# Removed some old settings

### `Configuration.startMaximized`
We think this is bad practice, because the size of the browser window depends on the current environment, which can lead to flaky tests. 
We recommend to use `Configuration.browserSize` instead (default value is `1366x768`). 

### `Configuration.versatileSetValue`

Most probably you didn't use it because it was `false` by default.    
Now for selecting a value from `<select>` or `<input type=radio>` you can use plain old methods `$.selectOptionByValue()` and `$.selectRadio()`. 

Thanks to [Boris Osipov](https://github.com/BorisOsipov) for [PR 1619](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1619).

# Fixed method `Selenide.sleep(N)`

It turns out that the standard Java method `Thread.sleep (N)` does not necessarily sleep exactly N ms, it can wake up earlier.
And this can cause flaky tests if your expected a certain pause.

Now method `Selenide.sleep(N)` is guaranteed to wait at least given number of milliseconds. 

See [implementation](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/blob/b05d53dfb794ee02e795587867c6ec8022171040/statics/src/main/java/com/codeborne/selenide/Selenide.java#L258).


<br>
# Added methods for adding/removing `WebDriverListener`

Selenide has method for adding `WebDriverEventListener`, but this class was replaced by `WebDriverListener` in Selenium 4.   
So we have to support both.  

<br>

See [issue 1615](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/1615) and  [PR 1616](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1616).


<br>
# Changed signature of method `Condition.apply`
It doesn't concern you until you created your custom Conditions.

Before now, class `Condition` had method `apply` which returned `boolean`:
```java
public boolean apply(Driver driver, WebElement element) 
```

Now you need to rename it to `check` and return `CheckResult` instead of `boolean`:
```java
public CheckResult check(Driver driver, WebElement element) 
```

This `CheckResult` contains not only flag "condition met / not met", but also a actual value at that moment.   
It allows Selenide to generate a better error message in case of test failure. 

P.S. Though, old method `apply` is not removed, but just marked as deprecated. So you can postpone this refactoring for some time.   

See [issue 217](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/217), 
[PR 1586](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1586) and 
[PR 1618](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1618).

# selenide-selenoid 2.0.1

We released [`selenide-selenoid:2.0.1`](https://github.com/selenide/selenide-selenoid/releases/tag/v2.0.1) with upgrade to Selenide 6.0.1

<br>
# selenide-appium

It seems that Appium doesn't support Selenium 4 yet, so we cannot upgrade `selenide-appium` yet. Stay tuned.

<br>
# UPD Selenide 6.0.2

We found a problem with projects using TestNG, released a hotfix 6.0.2.

See [issue 1623](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/1623)

<br>
# UPD Selenide 6.0.3

It appears that Maven can fetch an older version of `selenium-api-3*.jar` if it's found in a dependency tree (usually in BrowserUpProxy or Allure transitive dependencies).

I personally find this Maven behaviour misleading and just wrong. Maven could pick up a newer version.  
But since people often experience this problem, we decided to add a workaround on Selenide side.

See [workaround 1625](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1625)

# Other news
* Aerokube released [alternative WebDriver client](https://github.com/aerokube/lightning-java). In theory, Selenide could now use it under the hood instead of Selenium Webdriver. Sounds tempting? 
* I haven't figured it out yet, but people seem to be praising it: [some Docker images for Selenium](https://github.com/markhobson/docker-maven-chrome)
