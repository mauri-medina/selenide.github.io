Good evening!  

Today is January, 23.  

Let's meet the new update: [Selenide 5.18.0](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/milestone/113?closed=1).  

Let me invite you to take a small virtual tour of the changes in 5.18.0.   
Make yourself comfortable.

# We disabled webdriver logs by default

Starting from version 5.13.0, Selenide wrote webdriver logs to files `build/reports/tests/webdriver.uuid.log`.  
It seemed to be useful at that moment. But later we realized that these logs take quite a lot of disk space, 
and nobody really needs to read them in most cases. That's why we decided to disable them by default.

If you need those webdriver logs, you can still enable them with setting 
`Configuration.webdriverLogsEnabled = true`.

See [issue 1365](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/1365) and [PR 1379](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1379).

# Changed "timeout" parameter type from Long to Duration

... in collection methods. Now instead of 
```java
  $$.shouldHave(texts(...), 5000);
```

it is fashionable to write 
```java
  $$.shouldHave(texts(...), Duration.ofSeconds(5));
```

See [issue 1377](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/1377).  
Thanks to [Ostap Oleksyn](https://github.com/ostap-oleksyn) for [PR 1377](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1377).

# Speed up search of inner shadow dom elements

One of features that do exist in Selenide, but not in Selenium webdriver is [_shadow dom_](/2020/03/18/selenide-5.10.0/):

```java
$(shadowCss("p", "#shadow-host", "#inner-shadow-host"))
    .shouldHave(text("The Shadow-DOM inside another shadow tree"));
```

There might be multiple shadow roots inside of other shadow roots.  
To find all elements inside inner shadow roots, method `$(shadowCss())` performed a JavaScript snippet in loop for 
every shadow root separately. It might be slow because every call to webdriver takes time.  

Now `$(shadowCss())` calls one [even more trickier recursive JavaScript](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/blob/master/src/main/resources/find-in-shadow-roots.js) 
which finds all elements in all inner shadow roots with one call.  

See [PR 1373](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1373).

A separate "thank you" goes to [sakamoto66](https://github.com/sakamoto66) for 
[issue 1246](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/1246) and 
[PR 1233](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1233) 
which unfortunately was not merged, but inspired us for this optimization. 

<br/>

# Fixed checks `$.shouldNot(and(...))` and `$.shouldNot(or(...))`

Selenide user [pavelpp](https://github.com/pavelpp) detected a bug in Selenide when used `not` in combination with `and` and `or`:

```java
$(".lolkek").shouldNotBe(visible, ofSeconds(5));   // works
$(".lolkek").shouldNotBe(and("foo", visible));     // fails
$(".lolkek").shouldNotBe(or("foo", visible));      // fails
```

Now we fixed it. All three lines don't throw errors anymore. 

See [issue 1369](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/1369) and [PR 1370](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1370). 

By the way, we now forbid using `and` and `or` with only one condition. 
In other words, line `or("foo", visible)` doesn't compile anymore. 
You have to use at least two condition, like `or("foo", visible, enabled)`.

Agree, this is logical.

# We detect conflict in "browserName" capability

We recently realized that there are two settings for specifying browser:
1. The primary - `Configuration.browser`
2. Another - `Configuration.browserCapabilities["browserName"]` (I don't really know why it's needed)

And you might get an unexpected browser opened if you haven't set the first one, but set the second one. 
Now Selenide detects such a conflict and throws an exception:

```java
IllegalArgumentException: Conflicting browser name: 'chrome' vs. 'firefox'
```

Let me repeat: setting `Configuration.browser` is enough in all cases. As far as I know, the second setting is never needed.   
 
See [issue 1366](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/1366) and [PR 1374](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1374).

# Fixed displaying timeout parameter in reports

Recently we added to `$.should*` methods parameter `timeout` of type `Duration`.  
Then we realized it was displayed quite unclearly in Selenide/Allure reports.  

For example, line `$("h1").shouldBe(visible, Duration.ofSeconds(1))` looked like this in a report:

```java
$("h1") should be([visible, PT1M])
```

Though this "PT1M" is an ISO-compatible representation and means "time period 1 minute", we decided to replace it by 
more familiar "300 ms", "1s", "1.500 s." etc. 
 
See [issue 1376](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/1376) and [PR 1378](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1378).
