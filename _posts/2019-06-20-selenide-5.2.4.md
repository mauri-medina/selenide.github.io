Good evening from the Summer!

While people are celebrating Midsummer Day and Victory Day in Estonia, we are releasing Selenide 5.2.4.

What's new there?

<br/>

# We fixed proxy on localhost

As you know, Selenide can run its own embedded proxy server for some functions (file downloading, authorization, logging etc.).
But last versions of popular browsers (Chrome72+ and Firefox 67+) started denying proxy to intercept requests to `localhost` 
(for some security reasons).

That's why downloading of file got broken for those who run AUT on `http://localhost:port` (like me).

We had to dig into browser options and add tricky settings which allow proxy to intercept requests to `localhost`.

See [PR 950](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/950).

# We fixed ScreenShooterExtension for JUnit5

As you know, when Selenide throws an error (as a rule, it's a subclass of `UIAssertionError`), it always automatically 
takes a screenshot. In most cases it should be sufficient, but sometimes people want to use their own asserts 
(from JUnit, Hamcrest, AssertJ etc). Generally, Selenide cannot take screenshots in these cases - otherwise Selenide
would depend on all those frameworks.

But fortunately, Selenide has support for 3 most popular testing frameworks:
[JUnit4](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/blob/master/modules/junit4/src/main/java/com/codeborne/selenide/junit/ScreenShooter.java), 
[JUnit5](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/blob/master/statics/src/main/java/com/codeborne/selenide/junit5/ScreenShooterExtension.java), 
[TestNG](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/blob/master/modules/testng/src/main/java/com/codeborne/selenide/testng/ScreenShooter.java).

Recently we found a bug in [`ScreenShooterExtension`](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/blob/master/statics/src/main/java/com/codeborne/selenide/junit5/ScreenShooterExtension.java) for JUnit5. 
It took screenshots *only* for Selenide errors `UIAssertionError`. But should take for NON-selenide errors.
So we [fixed it](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/commit/5414bc743469d0624e6f5).

# We improved error message for `$$.shouldHave(texts("1", "2", "3"))`

Method `$$.shouldHave(texts(...))` allows to check texts of the whole collection of web elements.
Method `$$.shouldHave(texts(...))` allows to check texts of the whole collection of web elements.
For example, it's very convenient for checking a row or a column of a table. 
But in some (rare) cases it could report correct, but unclear error message. We improved it.

See [issue 454](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/454).<br/>
Thanks to [A.Smashentsev](https://github.com/xaknem) for [PR 944](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/944).

# Method `$.click(offsetX, offsetY)` now calculates coordinates for the CENTER of element

In addition to the "classical" method `$.click()`, Selenide has similar method `$.click(offsetX, offsetY)` for clicking with a shift.
While "classical" `$.click()` clicks at the center of element, method `$.click(offsetX, offsetY)` allows to click at any point of the element.

Here the difference comes: some browsers calculate the shift from center of element, while other - from left top corner.
Even Selenium documentation for class `org.openqa.selenium.interactions.Actions` has a contradiction on this topic:

```java
  /**
   * Moves the mouse to an offset from the top-left corner of the element.
   */
  public Actions moveToElement(WebElement target, int xOffset, int yOffset) {
    ...
    // Of course, this is the offset from the centre of the element. We have no idea what the width
    // and height are once we execute this method.
    ...
  }
```

Now we officially calculate shift from the **center of element**.
